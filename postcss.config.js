/** AUTO-SUMMARY **
   Purpose: This file configures plugins for a project, specifically for styling and browser compatibility.

   Key Components:
   - `tailwindcss`: Plugin for utility-first CSS framework.
   - `autoprefixer`: Plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.

   Functional Overview: The file sets up Tailwind CSS for handling utility-first styling and Autoprefixer to automatically add necessary CSS vendor prefixes, ensuring styles work across different browsers.

   Dependencies and Integrations: This configuration is typically used in conjunction with a build tool like Webpack or PostCSS setup in the project to process CSS files.

   Additional Context: The setup ensures that the styling of the application remains consistent and compatible with all modern browsers without manual prefixing.
