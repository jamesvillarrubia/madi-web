/** AUTO-SUMMARY **
   Purpose: This file serves as an index for exporting components and interfaces related to a UI feature, likely a loading spinner, from a specific module in the project.

   Key Components:
   - `interface`: Exports all from the interface file, likely containing type definitions or interfaces.
   - `Spin`: Exports the default Spin component, which is presumably a UI component for displaying a loading spinner.

   Functional Overview: The file facilitates the reusability and modularization of the Spin component and its associated interfaces by acting as a central export point. This allows other parts of the application to import the Spin component and any related interfaces easily.

   Dependencies and Integrations: This file depends on the `Spin` component and interfaces defined in the same module. It is likely used by other components or modules that require a loading spinner in the UI.

   Additional Context: Organizing exports in this manner helps in maintaining clean and manageable code, especially in larger projects where components are frequently reused across different parts of the application.
