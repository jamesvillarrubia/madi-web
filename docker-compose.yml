### AUTO-SUMMARY ###
#  Purpose: This file configures the settings for a service within a Docker environment, specifically for a web service.

#  Key Components:
#  - `services`: Defines the services being configured.
#  - `web`: Specifies the web service.
#  - `build`: Indicates the context for the build, set to the current directory.
#  - `ports`: Maps the container's ports to the host machine.

#  Functional Overview: The file sets up a web service in a Docker container, specifying that it should be built using the Dockerfile in the current directory and that port 3000 inside the container should be exposed to port 3000 on the host machine.

#  Dependencies and Integrations: This configuration relies on Docker and is likely part of a larger Docker Compose setup that may include other services.

#  Additional Context: This setup is crucial for local development and testing, ensuring that the web service can be accessed through the specified port on the host machine.
